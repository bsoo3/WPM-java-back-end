# WPM
words per minute calculator

I will code a front-end and back-end calculator, that tells u how fast you type.


INTERPRETATION OF THE JAVA CODE:
- so as you can see there is 4 files (words.txt, allWPM.txt, wpm.java, methods.java)
- words.txt is the file with 500 5 letter words
- allWPM.txt is where the calculated words per minute are going to be stored
- wpm.java is the main file
- methods.java all the methods being used in wpm.java
 
This code is OOP (object orianted project) that is why the wmp.java has a few lines of code


Will be adding more as the summer begins.
