# WPM
words per minute calculator

I will code a front-end and back-end calculator, that tells u how fast you type.

¤THE CODE IS NOT COMPLETEDE
¤THERE IS STILL A BUNCH OF STUFF TO DO

INTERPRETATION OF THE JAVA CODE:
- so as you can see there is 4 files (words.txt, allWPM.txt, wpm.java, methods.java)
- words.txt is the file with 500 5 letter words
- allWPM.txt is where the calculated words per minute are going to be stored
- wpm.java is the main file
- methods.java all the methods being used in wpm.java
 
This code is OOP (object orianted project) that is why the wmp.java has a few lines of code

UNDERSTANDING THE CODE
- first the program creates a count down from 3-1 
- then, the code reads words.txt file and randomly selects 15 words
- the words get printed out, now it is your job to type them out as fast as possible
- your wpm gets calculated, it prints it out and stores the wpm to the allWPM.txt file


Will be adding more as the summer begins.
